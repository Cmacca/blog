# Why You Should Stop Playing Video Games #
### 1/19/14 ####

I have seen too many friends fall into the slippery abyss called video games because of lack of social interaction or lack of personal drive and motivation. I also recently pulled myself out of the pit of pain - one of laziness and video games, and I have a few notes that will make you reconsider picking up Halo 4 and pressing "play".

### ** 1. Video games are detrimental to your health. ** ###

I used to sit around playing Roblox (Yes, I know, it's Minecraft for little kids) for hours on end while eating pizza, sausage, and pretty much any other unhealthy food you could think of. I most likely gained a few pounds after sitting around on the computer for 12 straight hours, and I found it agonizing to return to soccer practice (gruesome at best). Sure, a mental break here and there is always appreciated, but if you're blasting away countless hours on that Xbox, then it's time to reconsider your choices.

### ** 2. Video games kill productivity. ** ###

This is a fact that I have learned time and time again. Video games are designed to be addictive for the user by providing exciting plot, frequent updates, and ultimate achievements. Do not succumb to the madness! Usually even being in the same room as a gaming device can ultimately lead to distraction and failure to complete a task at hand. I've noticed that PC gaming has been exceptionally hard for me to master, for even the slightest thought about a new gaming tactic or place will send me spiralling back into the hole that I just escaped. I decided that it was time to take more drastic measures, and I installed a Google Chrome extension that blocked all of my unproductive websites for a specified period of time. I found that **will power is the key** factor here. Being able to man-up and make a plan to stop is one thing, but actually following through with a plan that one created to stop unproductive gaming is something else.

### ** 3. You could be doing better things. ** ###

Here's the part that gets me. Whenever I know I'm supposed to be doing something important (going to bed earlier than 2 AM, doing homework, learning new technologies), but I decide to neglect that activity anyways, I get a really bad feeling about how I should be doing said activity instead of gaming, showering, or - god forbid - sleeping. This nagging feeling is almost like a pain that waits to subside until I'm working on the task that I know I should be working on. Usually such tasks include working on learning new things and applying them so that I have a solid foundation to begin my college and work careers upon. To get to the point, there are **better things you could be doing** rather than sitting on the couch all day and earning meaningless achievements that 99.9% of the time cannot assist you in real life.

### ** 4. Video games are addicting. ** ###

This one is simple: video games are designed to specifically engage you in constant action so that **you want to play more, and more, and more.** Such an addiction can only be stopped cold turkey, and that's why the video game addiction battle is more psychological than physical.

### ** 5. You're wasting your life. ** ###

Remember that old hashtag from 2012? I believe it went something like #YOLO (You Only Live Once). It was poorly misinterpreted, and somehow ended up being correlated with getting drunk and doing drugs. However, the term #YOLO actually applies in the argument against video games. Simply put: you only have on life, and you're wasting it by watching pixels change colors on a screen. Kind of sad when you think about it. Go out and do something! I personally find real mountain biking much more exciting than the "Extreme Sports" by Microsoft's Kinect.

### ** 6. Video games can make you perceive life differently. ** ###

I can recall a time period when I was playing the ipod version of ABC's "The Walking Dead". When I was bored I would look for good hiding spots if a zombie apocalypse spontaneously occured, and sometimes I would look for the closest weapon in case I had to defend myself quickly. Let me tell you something before you have to experience this for yourself. **It's not fun.** As mentioned above, such a mindest is extremely **distracting**, especially when it comes to trying to accomplish a task in class or **learning** a new programming language.

### **7. One reason why you should play video games (periodically). ** ###

The entire concept behind the video game is to immerse oneself in an alternate reality in order to escape the perils of one's current reality. Video games are actually quite effective at this task, and they can ease stress levels during play because the player is able to focus on problems other than their own. I would actually recommend finding apps for your phone or games for your console that you may like to play for short periods of time. Doing this allows you to **decompress** after, say, a hard day at work, or a difficult family situation.
